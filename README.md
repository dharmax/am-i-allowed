# Am I Allowed
Agnostic, zero-dependencies, powerful, flexible and very easy to use permission/authorization 
library. 

## Background
Throughout the last 20 years or so, I worked with different implementations of permission systems and I also had
to implement such things myself three different times (and used each one in more than one application) in
various languages.
 
I learned that a good permission system can benefit and enrich a product quite a bit, so it was always 
one of the first thing i implemented in new applications.  

This is the 4th time i implemented such a library, and i managed to make it totally agnostic to
anything but the JavaScript language. 

It is a rather well documented, small TypeScript code, so for now most of the documentation
would be in the source.  

## Features
* Role-based
* Permission groups
* Hooks up to any storage for its own data with nearly zero effort
* Hooks up to any entity model you already have with nearly zero effort
* Built in rich, expandable Operations taxonomy that makes life easier.
* Smart default system to minimize coding and configuration of roles etc.   
* Sophisticated built-in logic which is easily expandable/replaced.
 

## Usage
### Install
`npm i am-i-allowed`

### Actual usage
For now, see the test source code. Would add stuff later.
